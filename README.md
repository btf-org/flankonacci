## Contributors Welcome!
I'd like to keep improving this and share the benefits with others. If you'd like to contribute, fork it or [reach out to me](https://github.com/anguspmitchell)

## Motivation and Demo
We lay boxes on top of boxes in Figma. Then we translate those designs into flexbox, grid, component libraries, and tailwind. Then we do code reviews, where the reviewer either 1) looks at "dead code" and tries to run a rendering engine in his brain to make sure this is good code, 2) pulls the branch, runs it locally, and tries to map boxes on the screen to lines of code in the PR.

Why can't we just design directly in flexbox, grid, component libraries, and tailwind? (And no, a text editor + hot reloading doesn't count)
